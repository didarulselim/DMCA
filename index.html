      <p class="home-heading">One of the greatest challenges all arms of government face every year is the task of dividing funds among many competing contractors and other interests. It is difficult for the simple reason that there never seems to be enough money to do everything requested. Not every program within every agency can be fully funded. <br>
The appropriation of funds is process whereby moneys are set aside for specific uses, it two-fold. First, it involves determining the amount of revenue available. Secondly, it involves appropriating money for the operations of the government (Federal, State or Local Government) and for various uses. <br>
No matter how many programs are being funded, DAC German Consulting is right here to help you review appropriation funding you may not know about. Bonding projects pursuant to Miller Act is codified at 40 U.S.C. § 3131-3134 requires a general contractor contracting with the federal government or a federal governmental entity for a construction project with a general or prime contract in excess of $100,000 to obtain both a performance bond and a payment bond from a surety acceptable to the officer awarding the contract.  After reviewing appropriation funding we also advise our client of appropriation spending contracts that are funded for bid and unbid appropriation contract that can be bid on. <br><br>

        <p>Under the Child's Online Privacy Security Act, no Website operator can require, as a condition to involvement in an activity, that a child younger than 13 years of age divulge more details than is reasonably required.

Children under 13 can submit only their email address when sending us an email in our "Contact Us" area. The company makes use of the email address to respond to a one-time demand from a child under 13 and afterwards deletes the email address. In case The company collects and maintains personal information relating to a child under 13, the parent may send out an email to us to review, alter and/or erase such info as well as to decline to enable any additional collection or use of the child's information.</p>
